# Overview

The goal of Symbulation is to provide an evolutionary agent-based framework for studying the evolution of symbiosis.

If you haven't already, we recommend first taking a look at the [browser-based GUI](https://anyaevostinar.github.io/SymbulationEmp/web/symbulation.html).

Then you can start with the [Getting Running](docs/QuickStartGuides/1-GettingRunning) guide, which includes running Symbulation both from the command line and a local browser-based GUI.
