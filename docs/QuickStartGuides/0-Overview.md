# Overview

The goal of Symbulation is to provide an evolutionary agent-based framework for studying the evolution of symbiosis.
It supports a population of hosts and a population of symbionts.
The symbionts can live inside of hosts (endosymbionts) or outside of hosts (free-living and/or ectosymbionts). 
The hosts and symbionts can engage in a relationship anywhere between full antagonism/parasitism to mutualism.

If you haven't already, we recommend first taking a look at the [browser-based GUI](https://anyaevostinar.github.io/SymbulationEmp/web/symbulation.html).

Then you can start with the [Getting Running](docs/QuickStartGuides/1-GettingRunning) guide, which includes running Symbulation both from the command line and a local browser-based GUI.
